msgid "This paper explores needs and opportunities around digital information and services associated with \"natural history collections\". This term is used here to refer particularly to institutional collections that hold preserved biological materials (specimens, tissues, DNA extracts, etc.). Several important use cases relate specifically to the role of these collections to support taxonomy and other fields of biological research. However, many of the requirements discussed here are common to other natural science collections, especially geoscience collections, living collections and privately-owned collections. We hope that this paper and the planned discussions will also address the needs of this wider community."

Users of specimen records need contextual information about the collection that holds the specimen, for example to communicate with collection managers about individual specimens, to offer corrections to specimen data, or simply to determine whether the collection is likely to hold quantities of similar specimens. It may be inefficient to embed all of this information within the specimen record. Holding a single authoritative copy assists with keeping the collection information current. The collection record may also contain information on taxonomic or geographic scope or other aspects that can resolve potential ambiguities within a specimen record. Links to current collection records will also enhance taxonomic publications referencing their materials. This is particularly important because catalogue numbers and other specimen identifiers used in publications may not link to digitised information on the specimens.
