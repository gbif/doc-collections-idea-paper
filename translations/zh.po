msgid "This paper explores needs and opportunities around digital information and services associated with \"natural history collections\". This term is used here to refer particularly to institutional collections that hold preserved biological materials (specimens, tissues, DNA extracts, etc.). Several important use cases relate specifically to the role of these collections to support taxonomy and other fields of biological research. However, many of the requirements discussed here are common to other natural science collections, especially geoscience collections, living collections and privately-owned collections. We hope that this paper and the planned discussions will also address the needs of this wider community."

It is a well-managed resource and highly regarded as a tool by the botanical community. No full equivalent exists globally for other natural history collections, although national/regional infrastructures such as the ALA collections pages, the iDigBio US Collections List, and the CETAF profiles serve similar roles.

Users of specimen records need contextual information about the collection that holds the specimen, for example to communicate with collection managers about individual specimens, to offer corrections to specimen data, or simply to determine whether the collection is likely to hold quantities of similar specimens. It may be inefficient to embed all of this information within the specimen record. Holding a single authoritative copy assists with keeping the collection information current. The collection record may also contain information on taxonomic or geographic scope or other aspects that can resolve potential ambiguities within a specimen record. Links to current collection records will also enhance taxonomic publications referencing their materials. This is particularly important because catalogue numbers and other specimen identifiers used in publications may not link to digitised information on the specimens. Linking to the collection simplifies future access and may enable digital links to be inferred in future."
msgstr "任何关于收集工作的准确信息可作为参考资料或与标本记录和其他数据对象相关联的数据使用。 标本记录的使用者需要关于标本的收藏的背景信息，例如与收集管理者就个别样本进行沟通，对标本数据进行纠正，或只是确定藏品中是否可能存在大量相似标本。将所有这些信息都嵌入标本记录可能是没有效率的。 但保存一份权威性的副本有助于使收集资料随时更新。 收集记录还可包含关于分类或地理范畴等其他方面的信息，标本记录中潜在的模棱两可之处也可以在这些信息中找到答案。与现有收藏记录的链接也将改善分类学出版物参考收藏信息。 这一点尤其重要，因为出版物中使用的目录编号和其他标本识别码可能与标本的数字化信息没有对应。 与收藏记录建立链接简化了今后的存取，可能会使今后使用数字链接。"

msgid "GBIF has the mission to provide global-scale support for biodiversity informatics solutions and has expanded its Registry to host the data historically maintained as GRSciColl. GRSciColl content is incomplete and is best seen as a framework for expansion with richer collection metadata that properly represents the needs and interests of collections. GBIF can serve as the context for integration and deduplication of collection information from different sources and for interlinking this information for other biodiversity data. GBIF requires guidance on the best way to support the needs and branding of collections and their communities as it develops such services.   \n"

However, it may be appropriate to delegate full or partial responsibility to thematic, regional or national communities that have data curators able to ensure the quality and standardisation of collection records. In some contexts, where institutions have for any reason not provided authoritative information, or do not have the resources to do so, there may be reason to allow or encourage a wider user base to contribute and improve collection records. In all cases, a version history is required for the information, so that users can understand and respond to changes made by others."
